\title{The betaHMM wrapper function}
\usage{
betaHMM(data, M, N, R, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe of dimension \eqn{C \times (N \times R)} containing
methylation values for \eqn{C} CpG sites from \eqn{R}
treatment groups each having \eqn{N} replicates or each collected
from \eqn{N} patients.}

\item{M}{Number of methylation states to be identified in a DNA sample.}

\item{N}{Number of patients or DNA sample replicates collected for each
treatment group.}

\item{R}{Number of treatment groups (For. eg: Benign and Tumour).}

\item{seed}{Seed to allow for reproducibility (default = NULL).}
}
\value{
The function returns an object of the
        \code{\link[betaHMM:betaHMM]{betaHMM}} class
        which contains the following values:
\itemize{
\item function_call - The parameters passed as arguments to the function
                      \code{\link[betaclust:betaclust]{betaclust}}.
\item K - The number of hidden states identified using the BHMMs.
\item C - The number of CpG sites analysed using the BHMMs.
\item N - The number of patients or DNA replicates corresponding to each
          treatment group analysed using the BHMMs.
\item R - The number of treatment groups analysed using the BHMMs.
\item A - The transition matrix for the BHMM model.
\item tau - The initial distribution for the BHMM model.
\item phi - The shape parameters for the observation sequence data
               in the BHMM model.
\item log_vec - A vector containing the log-likelihood values calculated
                   for each iteration of the algorithm.
\item z - A matrix of dimension \eqn{C \times K} containing the posterior
             probability of each CpG site belonging to each of the
             \eqn{K} clusters.
\item hidden_states - The vector containing the estimated hidden states
                         for each CpG sites.

\description{
A homogeneous hidden Markov model for the beta valued DNA
             methylation data.
}
\details{
A novel approach utilizing a homogeneous hidden Markov model and
         effectively model untransformed beta values to identify DMCs while
         considering the spatial correlation of the adjacent CpG sites
